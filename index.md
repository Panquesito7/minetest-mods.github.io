This project exists to **provide a semi-trusted source of Minetest Mods**.
Mods here should be stable (at least in the master branches).
All mods should work well together.

## How is a Mod added?

The original author of the Mod should be the one submitting it to the minetest-mods
project. Contact a [minetest-mods admin](https://github.com/orgs/minetest-mods/people).

## Can any Minetest mod be added?

* Mods should preferrably be licensed under an OSI approved license.
* Mods do not need to be minetest-licensing compatible (meaning, GPL3.0+ is fine)
* Non-OSI licenses may be acceptable.
* Public Domain is not defined well in many countries, so licenses such as WTFPL,
  MIT or CC0 should be used.

## What's in it for users?

* A central place to find well-maintained mods.
* Clarity as to which fork is the recommended version of a mod.
* Well-defined mods with proper metadata that work without renaming and installation issues.
* The security of knowing many more developers are looking at mod code than just one person.

## What's in it for developers?
* Knowing that they can take a break from Minetest when they need or choose to, and that someone will be capable of taking care of their mods.
* A large group of experienced mod developers that are willing to help out improve their code.
* More users looking at their mods and better exposure.
