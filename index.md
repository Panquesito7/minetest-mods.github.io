This project exists to **provide a semi-trusted source of Minetest Mods**.
Mods here should be stable (at least in the master branches).
All mods should work well together.

## How is a project added?

The original author of the mod should be the one submitting it to the minetest-mods
project. Contact a [minetest-mods admin](https://github.com/orgs/minetest-mods/people).

## Can any Minetest mod be added?

* Mods must be licensed under an OSI approved license
* Mods do not need to be minetest-licensing compatible (meaning, GPL3.0+ is fine)
* Non-OSI licenses may be acceptable
* Public Domain is not defined well in many countries, so licenses such as WTFPL,
  MIT or CC0 should be used.

## Got any more questions?
